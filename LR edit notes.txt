See notes on issue I raise in the original repo. In addition to below, I had to:
1. do one other thing for Diabetes (that is in the file I changed)- cant remember what
2. for Clinical, change Model to Model A in parameters.

...couple of minor tweaks. I have recorded them here in case it helps anyone.
I installed Numpy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, xlrd, Open pyxl, cvx opt, NetworkX and the last version of python 3.6. I ended up downgrading Pandas and Numpy to versions available in early 2019, but I dont know if that was necessary.

Blood, Energy, Dynamic, Static and News repos all worked straight away.

Adapt repo worked once I had deleted the first row in Base parameters.xlsx

Diabetes repo worked once I had:

added the argument index_col=0 into the Driver Script for the read_excel function for Additional_params and for S0
In ModelFile, Changed the .loc pandas operation for additional_params.loc['sigma-w',0] by changing 0 to '0'
Did the same for looking up .loc['truth-type',0] in the ModelFile
did the same for .loc['increment',0] in the DriverScript
In Driver Script, I added the line state_names=['M','Sens','Secr','AGI','PA'] into Driver_script and then modified the call to the create an instance of the Model class, changing the first of the four arguments to 'state_names', instead of the reference to the x_names
Asset repo worked once I added argument 'index_col=0 to the read_excel function for biasdf in the DriverScript

Clinical repo worked I had deleted a column in the spreadsheet so that 'Potential_pop':float(data.iat[0,0]) referred correctly.
